# RoRAssist 
- This is supporting app for board game "Republic of Rome", created by Don Greenwood and released by Avalon Hill in 1990.

- Application will provide support for all the calculations necessary for gameplay, and hopefully speed-up the game time for players. It will calculate wars, state treasury, persuasion attempts and many more. Possibly there will be assistant for game setup, turn-order cheat-sheets and fast explanation of rules for new players.
